# Safe Baby Handling Guide

## Picking Up the Baby

- **Wash Your Hands:** Always ensure your hands are clean before handling the baby to prevent the spread of germs.
- **Approach Gently:** Move slowly and calmly towards the baby to avoid startling them.
- **Support Head and Neck:** Slide one hand under the baby's head and neck, and the other hand under their bottom. Newborns do not have strong neck muscles, so head support is crucial.
- **Lift Gradually:** Gently and steadily lift the baby up to your chest level. Keep the baby's head close to your body to provide additional support.

## Holding the Baby

### Cradle Hold
- Rest the baby's head in the crook of your elbow with the same-side hand supporting the rest of the body.
- Use your other hand to support the baby’s bottom.
- Ensure the baby’s head is elevated slightly to help with breathing.

### Shoulder Hold
- Place the baby over your shoulder, using one hand to support the baby’s bottom.
- Use the other hand to support the baby’s back and head.

### Belly-Down (Elbow Support) Hold
- Lay the baby’s chest against your forearm, with their face turned to one side for breathing.
- Use your hand to support the baby’s chin and jaw (avoiding the throat).
- The baby’s legs should straddle your arm.
- This position is often calming for babies with gas or colic.

### Lap Hold
- Sit down and place the baby face up on your lap.
- Support the baby's head with one hand and use the other to interact or play with the baby.

## Laying Down the Baby

- **Approach the Crib or Bed Slowly:** Holding the baby securely, move towards the crib or bed.
- **Lower with Care:**
   - Gently lower the baby into the crib. Bend at your knees rather than your waist to get closer to the surface.
   - Keep one hand under the baby's head and neck and the other under their bottom.
- **Release Slowly:** Once the baby’s back touches the crib, slowly remove the hand from underneath the bottom, followed by the hand supporting the head.
- **Ensure Safety:** Make sure the baby is lying on their back, which is the recommended position to reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).
